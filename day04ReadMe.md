Show factorial and fibonacci as examples. Show non-recursive implementation of fibonacci.

1. Write a recursive function that takes one numeric parameter, n, and returns a string with the numbers n down to 0, separated by spaces.

2. Write a function 'recursiveMultiplier' that takes two arguments, 'arr and num', and multiplies each arr value into by num and returns an array of the values.

3. Write a function 'RecursiveExponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, recursively returns exponent value of the base.

4. Write a function 'recursiveReverse' that takes an array and uses recursion to return its contents in reverse. Show implementation with helper function that builds array and a standard implementation.

5. Implement a function that flattens a nested array.
flatten([ [[[[55]]]],  1, [2] ,  ["thug life", [[4]]]   ]);
=> [1,2,3,4]

6. Implement a function that will reverse a string recursively.
reverse('abcdefg')
=> 'gfedcba'
